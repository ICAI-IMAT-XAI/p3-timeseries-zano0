# Laboratory 03 — Time Series XAI and uncertainty 

This repository contains the materials for Laboratory Practice 03: Time series. The laboratory consists in completing the comments in the `panama_load.ipynb` notebook.

All necessary instructions are in the notebook. This is much less guided than the previous one, so I recommend you to think and revisit the theory slides to come up with ideas.

Good luck and enjoy the lab!
